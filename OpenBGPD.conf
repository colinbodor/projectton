# Router ID
# It's good practice to set this to one of your public IPv4 addresses.
# This can also be left blank and OpenBGPd will use the highest IPv4 address
# assigned to the device

# If you are using "nexthop blackhole" then you will need to update the FIB:
fib-update yes

# blackhole list providers:
group "blackholes" {
  announce IPv4 none
